<h3 id="blender">Blender</h3>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>My first foray into modeling with blender was retrofitting the whack a mole game for oculus. I can’t say it went terribly well, it worked, but had some weird seams, a horrible flat surface, and other glitchiness. I also wanted to create a nice indoor scene but my brick pattern for the wall (this was just a cube!) wouldn’t apply correctly on the walls. What’s going on?? Why can’t I just download a program to instantly understand a skill when I would like to use it like the helicopter in the matrix?</p>

<p>The udemy course I mentioned in the previous post is great in the fact that it teaches the blender modeling as well as the unity side for every mini game - but the whack a mole instruction came with a pdf, while none of the rest of them did. I was having more luck following the pdf since I could go at my own pace flipping back and forth. Besides, I’m getting a real hankering to play skeeball at this point and create my own skeeball machine!</p>

<p>I had a period of time coming up where I wouldn’t be able to wear the oculus, so I decided to really settle in and start off with the blender donut series. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4">Andrew Price’s blender donut series</a> seems to be all the rage, so that’s where I started, naturally.</p>

<p>The donut tutorial took a few days off and on to get through, was super high quality, definitely recommended. Andrew focuses on hitting the high notes of all the tools - you don’t get too deep with modeling, but scratch the surface of everything, and get a lot of practice with the tooling, keyboard shortcuts, and such.</p>

<p>Here are a few shots of my work of art while it was in progress…</p>

<p>The biggest takeaways for me at this point -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Face orientation! Easy to get wrong and it leaves you with holes in your model</li>
  <li>UV Unwrapping - finally mostly understand the idea here. This is why I couldn’t put my brick material on the wall!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-to-the-arcade">Back to the arcade</h2>

<p>With my newfound skills I went back to skeeball. I mostly scrapped an attempt at modeling I had started, and tried to keep the model really clean this time.</p>

<p>Not too bad!</p>
