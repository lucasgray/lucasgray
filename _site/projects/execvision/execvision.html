<p>I’ve worked at <a href="https://www.execvision.io/">Execvision</a> since 2018 as the engineering manager for the product team.  As a remote first team with senior developers, we are a high output team with a blissfuly meeting free calendar.</p>

<h2 id="some-project-highlights-include">Some project highlights include…</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Coaching - we built <a href="https://www.execvision.io/product/coaching/">coaching functionality</a> into the app from the ground up, and have continued to expand on it for the past few years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.execvision.io/product/smart-alerts/">Smart alerts</a> - generic IFTTT type “triggers” that end users can set up in order to receive passive alerts when things happen in the system. For example, when a word is mentioned on a call, when scores dip, or when you receive feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.execvision.io/product/performance-dashboards/">Dashboards</a>, always dashboards - pretty charts and other data displays to give you a bird’s eye view of how your organization is doing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="call-cards">Call Cards</h2>
<p>We recently (Jan 2021) revamped our call display - with a new layout that puts information about the topics discussed in the call first. I rebuilt the waveform display and page layout from the ground up. The colored parts of the waveform denote the energy the topic has - so topics that have tighter clusters are showed visibly by having more area under the lines. The algorithm isn’t quite perfect but is a good bird’s eye view of topics discussed in a call.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a video call, we use a PIP view that a user can drag and drop to move, expand to the full view, etc (click these to embiggen, the screenshots are enormous due to my lavish 4k monitor).</p>

<p>The next screenshot is an example of a call that I received an email about due to a Smart Alert - A user coached the call, so I got an alert about it - with a link into the app to show the call.  The coaching happens via comments and highlights displayed under the call waveform.</p>
