# [Execvision](https://www.execvision.io/)

I've worked at [Execvision](https://www.execvision.io/) for two years now as the engineering manager for the product team.  As a remote first team with senior developers, we are a high output team with a blissfuly meetingless calendar. 

## Some project highlights include...

* Coaching - we built [coaching functionality](https://www.execvision.io/product/coaching/) into the app from the ground up, and have continued to expand on it for the past few years. 

* [Smart alerts](https://www.execvision.io/product/smart-alerts/) - generic IFTTT type "triggers" that end users can set up in order to receive passive alerts when things happen in the system. For example, when a word is mentioned on a call, when scores dip, or when you receive feedback.

* [Dashboards](https://www.execvision.io/product/performance-dashboards/), always dashboards - Pretty charts and other data displays to give you a bird's eye view of how your organization is doing.
