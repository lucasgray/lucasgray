I worked at [Execvision](https://www.execvision.io/) from 2018-2021 as the engineering manager for the product team.  As a remote first team with senior developers, we were a high output team with a blissfully meeting free calendar. 

## Some project highlights include...

* Coaching - we built [coaching functionality](https://www.execvision.io/product/coaching/) into the app from the ground up. A manager or coach can create a coaching plan for their reps and periodically meet with them on a schedule. 

* [Smart alerts](https://www.execvision.io/product/smart-alerts/) - generic IFTTT type "triggers" that end users can set up in order to receive passive alerts when things happen in the system. For example, when a word is mentioned on a call, when scores dip, or when you receive feedback.

* [Dashboards](https://www.execvision.io/product/performance-dashboards/), always dashboards - pretty charts and other data displays to give you a bird's eye view of how your organization is doing.

## Call Cards
In January 2021 we revamped our call display - with a new layout that puts information about the topics discussed in the call first. I rebuilt the waveform display and page layout from the ground up. The colored parts of the waveform denote the energy the topic has - so topics that have tighter clusters are showed visibly by having more area under the lines. The algorithm isn't quite perfect but is a good bird's eye view of topics discussed in a call.

The following is an example of a video call, we use a PIP view that a user can drag and drop to move, expand to the full view, etc (click these to embiggen, the screenshots are enormous due to my lavish 4k monitor).

The next screenshot is an example of a call that I received an email about due to a Smart Alert - A user coached the call, so I got an alert about it - with a link into the app to show the call.  The coaching happens via comments and highlights displayed under the call waveform.
